# Tweet Thread

### [twitter.timwhite.digital](http://twitter.timwhite.digital/)

This is a Laravel Lumen project I put together in a weekend. It allows the user to have a single block of text post to Twitter as chained, 140 character tweets, if they choose to structure it that way of course.

The front-end uses ES6 with Babelify, Gulp etc.
